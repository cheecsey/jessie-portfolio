# Jessie Bacchi's Portfolio

A custom-built personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, personality, and projects in a clean, expressive, and tech-forward layout.

## ✨ Overview
This website is designed to highlight my journey as a software engineer and game developer. It features an “About Me” section, a curated list of completed projects, and links to my resume and GitHub repositories. Every element on the page was hand-planned, coded manually, and styled to reflect who I am — both professionally and creatively.

## 📌 Problem Statement
In a world full of cookie-cutter templates, I wanted a portfolio that not only showcases my technical skills but also reflects my creativity and individuality. Instead of relying on frameworks or pre-built layouts, I built everything from scratch to stay in full control of the visual feel and UX. The goal: present myself in the most authentic and tech-savvy way possible.
